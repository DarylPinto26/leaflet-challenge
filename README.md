# leaflet-challenge

## Background:
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Deliverables:
> Got url from USGS website for All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days to pull data for visualization
> 
> Used leaflet to create a map which plots all earthquakes in the past 7 days based on longitude and latitudes
> 
> Markers for earthquake are setup to be larger in size for higher magnitudes of earthquake, and different colors for different depth ranges
>
> Provided a popup when a marker is clicked, to show more details about the earthquake event
>
> Finally, added a legend to give context to the data represented on the map.
